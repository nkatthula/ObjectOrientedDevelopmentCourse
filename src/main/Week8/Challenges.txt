Challenges and difficulties I faced for Fertilizer Management System project is using builder pattern to set
the values for the Fertilizer and Farmer details, so that I need not to set the values for unwanted variable.
Implementing the factory design to create an instance for the entering data. Another challenge is to add Junit tests as this is my first time to work on it.
Apart from these it was a fun ride working on this project.
